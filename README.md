I’ll be giving a 3.5 hour deep learning workshop at PyCon 2024 in May. This tutorial is aimed at Python

programmers new to PyTorch and deep learning. However, even more experienced deep learning practitioners and PyTorch users may be exposed to new concepts and ideas when exploring other open source libraries to extend PyTorch.

**It’s my first PyCon, and I’m very excited!**
